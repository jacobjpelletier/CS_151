December 9 – December 13   Final exams: check University schedule for days/times.

Tests and quizzes: There will be two tests and five quizzes during the semester designed as evaluation devices intended to prompt the student to stay abreast of assigned topics. Test dates will be announced in advance, while quizzes may be given un-announced at any time. No make-ups for missed quizzes will be granted. Make-ups for missed tests will only be granted in exceptional cases, following a timely arrangement BEFORE the test via e-mail explaining the reason for missing the test. NO EXTRA WORK TO COMPENSATE FOR POOR PERFORMANCE ON TESTS OR MISSED QUIZZES WILL BE GIVEN, except for the EXTRA 5 points already included in the grading formula.

Final exam: This will be a cumulative objective test on the entire semester's offerings.

Class discussion: Since the style of the class sessions is interactive, students are expected to come to class with prepared questions, comments and answers to the assigned exercises and projects.

Homeworks: Six official homeworks will be given ("unofficial" ones need not be submitted -- but they are not less important -- do not ignore them). The student is responsible for constructing a set of test cases which cover all of the possibilities inherent in that program assignment. Homeworks will be submitted via Blackboard Learn. They must include the following: (1) a pseudo code/ UML or flow chart of problem solutions (whichever is preferred or appropriate), except for homework 1; (2) java code; (3) example runs (outputs) of the programs needed to demonstrate their correctness; and (4) all relevant files needed to run them. Homeworks will be graded upon degree of success, precise implementation of the theoretical concepts and use of an appropriate program structure  as discussed in class. No “free style” unrelated to the concepts discussed in class programs will be accepted – they will bring you 0 points even if they produce the expected result. All homework assignments must be submitted by the due date. There will be a penalty for late submissions. Homeworks must be INDEPENDENT student work. “Share the work, share the grade” policy will be followed for grading shared work. Homeworks that are clearly NOT done by the student will be given 0 points. 

Academic honesty: All homeworks, tests and quizzes must be an individual effort of the student submitting the work for grading. See the section "Policy on Academic Honesty" in the CCSU Student Handbook.

Attendance: It is expected that the student will attend class sessions regularly. Absences result in the student being totally responsible for the make-up process. 

Student conduct: It is expected that all students will conduct themselves in a respectful manner, and will assist in maintaining an atmosphere conductive to learning in the classroom.

Grades and evaluation: The student will be evaluated regularly during the semester as follows 

   - Test 1: 15 points. It provides 15% of the final grade.
   - Test 2: 15 points. It provides 15% of the final grade.
   - Quizzes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: 2 points each. They provide 10% of the final grade.
   - Homeworks  1 and 2: 5 points each. Each provides 5% of the final grade.
   - Homeworks  3 and 4: 7 points each. Each provides 7% of the final grade.
   - Homeworks  5 and 6: 8 points each. Each provides 8% of the final grade.
   - Final exam: 25 points. It provides 25% of the final grade.
   
   Maximum points: 105, 5 of which are BONUS POINTS. 

   The final grade for the course will be determined as follows:

   Total points       Final grade
   ---------------      --------------
    93 - 105                A
    90 - 92.99             A-
